# Updated Library System

## Overview

This updated version of the Library System is implemented in C++ and includes enhancements such as encapsulation, a `Book` class, and improved code organization. The program allows users to manage a collection of books by providing features like adding books, searching for books by author or title, displaying sorted books, and quitting the system.

## Features

1. **Add Books (Choice 1):**
   - Users can add new books to the library by entering details such as title, author, and publication year.

2. **Search for an Author (Choice 2):**
   - Users can search for books based on the author's last name. The system displays books by the specified author along with their publication years and positions.

3. **Search for by Book Title (Choice 3):**
   - Users can search for books based on the title. The system displays books matching the specified title along with their authors, publication years, and positions.

4. **Display Books (Choice 4):**
   - Displays the list of books sorted by the author's last name using the Selection Sort algorithm.

5. **Quit (Choice 5):**
   - Allows users to exit the Library System.

## Code Organization

### `Book` Class

The `Book` class encapsulates the properties and behavior of a book. It includes member functions for getting and setting attributes, as well as additional functions like `getAuthorLastName()` and `display()` for convenience.

### Sorting Algorithm

The `SelectSort` function uses the Selection Sort algorithm to sort the list of books by the author's last name in ascending order.

### Search Operations

- `bsearch`: Performs a binary search to find books by a specified author and returns their positions.
- `SearchTitle`: Searches for books based on the title and returns the position if found.

## Usage Instructions
